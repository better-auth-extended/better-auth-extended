## **Checklist**

- [ ] I checked that the resource is not already listed.
- [ ] I provided a clear and concise description of the resource.
- [ ] I included a valid and working link to the resource

**Important Notes:**

1. If you are introducing a new section, you must add it to `apps/www/content/categories.ts` aswell as `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/marketplace.md`.
2. This repository focuses on open-source and freely accessible projects. Paid or fully commercial resources will not be accepted.

Just a heads-up: no need to add a date - our system takes care of that automatically!
